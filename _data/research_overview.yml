     Divertor detachment is the reactor-relevant regime where parallel heat/particle fluxes to target plates are reduced by momentum and power loss in the divertor volume. As density (or fueling) is raised, the ionization source rolls over, recombination and molecular channels strengthen, and the ionization/recombination front modifies upstream; Balmer line brightness are most sensitive signature of this change. 
     Building on my spectroscopy and edge-diagnostics work, I led a DIII-D experiment that (i) executed a controlled density scan across multiple Greenwald fractions, (ii) used absolutely calibrated spectroscopic views to measure Balmer emissisons brightness (low-n to high-n) and selected line ratios, (iii) separated excitation vs. recombination contributions (using Bayesian based Spectroscopic technique for Plasma-Molecular Interaction - Verhaegh, Kevin, et al. Nuclear Fusion 63.1 (2022): 016014.)
     This is usful for detachment quantification through Atomic and Molecular Physics and understanding impact of it on power, particle and momentum balance. My work is validated the code for DIII-D tokamak (because of different line-of-sights). Future work includes detachment quantification with different divertor configuration and with H-mode plasmas.
