     Divertor detachment is the reactor-relevant regime where parallel heat/particle fluxes to target plates are reduced by momentum and power loss in the divertor volume. As density (or fueling) is raised, the ionization source rolls over, recombination and molecular channels strengthen, and the ionization/recombination front modifies upstream; Balmer line brightness are most sensitive signature of this change. 
     Building on my spectroscopy and edge-diagnostics work, I led a DIII-D experiment that (i) executed a controlled density scan across multiple Greenwald fractions, (ii) used absolutely calibrated spectroscopic views to measure Balmer emissisons brightness (low-n to high-n) and selected line ratios, (iii) separated excitation vs. recombination contributions (using Bayesian based Spectroscopic technique for Plasma-Molecular Interaction - Verhaegh, Kevin, et al. Nuclear Fusion 63.1 (2022): 016014.)
     This is usful for detachment quantification through Atomic and Molecular Physics and understanding impact of it on power, particle and momentum balance. My work is validated the code for DIII-D tokamak (because of different line-of-sights). Future work includes detachment quantification with different divertor configuration and with H-mode plasmas.

      I install, align, and commission  CCD and sCMOS detectors  on visible/NIR spectrometers to deliver quantitative, wavelength-accurate measurements. That includes setting focal planes and slit aligment, optimizing f/# coupling, and verifying  point-spread functions  with narrow calibration lines. I perform full absolute/relative intensity and wavelength calibration (Hg/Ne/Ar lamps). In parallel, I maintain and operate  time-resolved detectors —photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and fast photodiodes—integrated through low-noise preamplifiers and discriminators for microsecond–millisecond plasma emission studies. These systems are synchronized to machine timing via hardware triggers and delay generators, with signal paths verified on  digital storage oscilloscopes  and logged through DAQ modules for shot-by-shot analysis.
      I have also done precision cleaving and  fusion splicing  for SMA connectors, inspection under a fiber scope, and careful routing with minimum bend radii to preserve throughput. I design and mount fore-optics (apertures, bandpass filters, relay lenses) on the tokamak to define collection volumes and reject stray light, and I maintain alignment. My electronics work spans specifying and wiring low-noise  preamps/amplifiers , configuring  signal/function generators  for calibration pulses, and implementing proper grounding/shielding to suppress EMI in high-current environments. I also write the acquisition/control scripts to coordinate shutters, filter wheels, camera SDKs, and trigger logic, and I maintain a calibration ledger so every dataset is traceable (lamp ID, detector gain, slit width, fiber and optics stack). Collectively, this toolkit—optomechanics, detectors, vacuum practice, and electronics—lets me deliver  absolute, time-resolved spectroscopic data  that are ready for physical inference (temperature, flow, opacity) and robust shot-to-shot comparison.

       On ADITYA-U, I combined absolutely calibrated visible measurements with openADAS database (https://open.adas.ac.uk), I demonstrated that **stainless-steel wall regions dominate recycling** relative to carbon limiters and quantified how wall state alters early-shot recycling coefficients and impurity source terms. I performed controlled wall-conditioning studies—**lithiumization** and **glow-discharge cleaning (GDC)**—and showed, through before/after balances and influx reconstructions, how Li coatings suppress chemical sputtering/oxygen-bearing influx while GDC reconditions surfaces to reduce prompt recycling and improve fueling efficiency.

      Neutral and impurity transport in the edge is quantified using the Monte-Carlo neutral code **DEGAS2** to capture atomic/molecular kinetics of hydrogenic species, and an **indigenously developed SITA** (Study of Impurity Transport in ADITYA-U) code to evolve multi-charge-state impurities along field lines with cross-field diffusion and convective/pinch terms. Reproduced emission intensities are matched with experimentally measured emissivity (Abel inversion used to get emissivity). With impurity transport study using SITA, I perform scans of **effective diffusivity (D)** and **convective velocity (V)** for multiple species (O, C, Ne, Ar, Fe).

     In linear RF and arc plasmas—including a **Plasma Wind Tunnel (PWT)**—I developed a spectroscopy workflow that links molecular/atomic emission directly to the thermodynamic state of the discharge. On the molecular side, I extract **vibrational temperatures** (T_v) of **(\mathrm{N_2})** (Second Positive System, SPS) and **CN** (Violet System, when present) using band-head Boltzmann plots with **rotational-envelope corrections**. This explicitly process the spectrum by substracting the background and evaluating the Boltzmann plot for temperature measurement. 
     A key use case of this platform is **controlled (\mathrm{H_2}) contamination studies**. By seeding (\mathrm{H_2}) into nominal (\mathrm{N_2}) flows, I quantify: (i) **quenching and energy-transfer effects** on the (\mathrm{N_2}) SPS intensity distribution and derived (T_v); (ii) the emergence of **Fulcher-α** ((d^3\Pi_u!\to!a^3\Sigma_g^+)) bands that constrain **(\mathrm{H_2}) rotational/vibrational excitation**; and (iii) the consequent shifts in inferred (T_e) from atomic line ratios when hydrogen alters the **electron energy distribution** and collisional pathways. Where appropriate, I use **actinometric normalizations** (e.g., trace Ar) and **absolute calibration** (lamp-based) to translate relative spectra into quantitative emissivities.
     Because the **PWT** and bench RF sources offer stable, well-diagnosed boundary conditions (fixed flow, simple geometry), these measurements provide a **clean testbed** to validate CR models and **rate coefficients** that are later deployed in tokamak edge analysis. Practically, the linear-device results improve **spectrometer calibration** (spectral response and line-shape), refine our treatment of **rotational–vibrational energy exchange** and **dissociation pathways**, and quantify how trace (\mathrm{H_2}) modifies (\mathrm{N_2})/CN diagnostics.
