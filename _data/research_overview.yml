    Divertor detachment is a reactor-relevant regime in which parallel heat and particle fluxes to the targets
    are reduced by volumetric momentum and power losses in the divertor. As density or fueling increases,
    the ionization source rolls over, recombination and molecular channels strengthen, and the ionization/
    recombination front retreats—changes that are imprinted on Balmer emissivity and line ratios. Building
    on my spectroscopy and edge-diagnostics background, I led a DIII-D experiment that (i) executed a
    controlled density scan across multiple Greenwald-fraction levels, (ii) used absolutely calibrated views to
    measure Balmer brightness from low-n to high-n and diagnostic line ratios, and (iii) separated excitation
    and recombination contributions using a Bayesian analysis framework adapted for plasma–molecular
    interaction. These measurements enable quantitative detachment metrics grounded in atomic and molecular
    physics and clarify impacts on power, particle, and momentum balance. Ongoing work validates the
    methodology across DIII-D’s different sightlines and extends the analysis to alternative divertor
    configurations and H-mode plasmas.

    SpectralGUI is a Python/OMFIT application I built to accelerate analysis of time-resolved spectroscopy
    on DIII-D (WiSE/HRUVS/SPRED/Avantes). It has (top-left) a calibrated time–wavelength
    brightness map, (top-right) an instantaneous spectrum with line-ID overlays, and (bottom) an integrated
    intensity vs. time trace. Interactive sliders and ROI tools let users pick time windows or wavelength
    bands, then export either “time slice” spectra or “time profile” traces with one click. An element palette
    toggles labeled candidates (H/D Balmer, He, C, N, O, Ar, Ne, Xe, etc.) and supports custom linelists.
    The pipeline preserves absolute calibration, applies background handling. Designed on Matplotlib+Qt, 
    it runs inside OMFIT and on cluster backends with the same controls, enabling reproducible, 
    fast turnaround from raw frames to physics-quality diagnostics.

    I install, align, and commission CCD and sCMOS detectors on visible/NIR spectrometers to deliver
    quantitative, wavelength-accurate measurements—setting focal planes and slit alignment, optimizing f/#
    coupling, and verifying point-spread functions with narrow calibration lines. I perform absolute/relative
    intensity and wavelength calibration (Hg/Ne/Ar lamps) and maintain time-resolved detector paths
    (photomultiplier tubes and fast photodiodes) through low-noise preamplifiers and discriminators for
    microsecond–millisecond studies. Systems are synchronized to machine timing via hardware triggers and
    delay generators; signal integrity is verified on digital oscilloscopes and logged through DAQ for
    shot-resolved analysis. I also handle precision fiber cleaving and fusion splicing for SMA connectors,
    fore-optics design (apertures, bandpass filters, relay lenses) to define collection volumes and reject stray
    light, and vacuum practice for spectrometer maintenance. My electronics work spans low-noise
    preamps/amplifiers, function generators, and robust grounding/shielding against EMI. Acquisition/control
    scripts coordinate shutters, filter wheels, camera SDKs, and trigger logic, with a calibration ledger to keep
    every dataset traceable. This toolkit produces absolute, time-resolved spectra ready for inference of
    temperature, flows, and opacity with reliable shot-to-shot comparisons.

    Using absolutely calibrated visible spectroscopy tied to atomic data, I quantified how plasma-facing
    components set neutral/impurity influx, recycling, and global particle balance. On ADITYA-U I showed
    that stainless-steel wall regions dominate early-shot recycling relative to carbon limiters and mapped how
    wall state modifies source terms for hydrogenic and impurity species. Through controlled wall-conditioning
    studies—lithiumization and glow-discharge cleaning (GDC)—I carried out before/after particle-balance
    reconstructions and influx estimates, demonstrating suppressed chemical sputtering and oxygen-bearing
    influx after Li coatings and improved fueling efficiency following GDC. The framework provides a
    consistent path from line-of-sight radiance to machine-level particle accountability.

    I quantify edge neutral and impurity transport using the Monte-Carlo neutral code DEGAS2 for
    hydrogenic kinetics and an indigenously developed SITA (Study of Impurity Transport in ADITYA-U)
    code that advances multi-charge-state impurities along field lines with cross-field diffusion and
    convective/pinch terms. Synthetic emission is matched to experiment (with Abel-inverted emissivity where
    applicable) to constrain transport. With SITA I perform scans of effective diffusivity (D) and convective
    velocity (V) for O, C, Ne, Ar, and Fe, and assess sensitivity to profiles and atomic data. I also analyze how
    molecular hydrogen alters recycling source terms and neutral penetration, feeding back to detachment and
    wall-interaction interpretations.
    Neutral temperature in the edge is a key control knob for particle fueling and momentum/energy exchange, 
    because it sets the efficiency of charge-exchange and ionization with escaping ions. I determine it spectroscopically—most 
    commonly from Doppler broadening of Hα (and, where available, Fulcher-α rotational fits for H₂)—using absolutely 
    calibrated, line-of-sight views. On ADITYA-U, my measurements revealed a clear **poloidal asymmetry** in neutral 
    temperature: views near the inboard side and upper limiter recorded cooler, slower neutrals than views near the 
    outboard mid-plane and lower limiter. This asymmetry arises from a combination of geometry and physics—localized 
    recycling sources (limiters, wall tiles) that heat neutrals through repeated charge-exchange, longer neutral 
    mean-free-paths along shallow incidence field lines, E×B/∇B-driven SOL drifts that convect hot ions toward specific 
    strike regions, and sightline integration through different path lengths and densities.

    In linear RF and arc discharges—including a Plasma Wind Tunnel (PWT)—I developed a spectroscopy
    workflow that links emission to thermodynamic state. I extract vibrational temperatures of N2 (Second
    Positive System) and CN (Violet System) using band-head Boltzmann plots with rotational-envelope
    corrections, after instrument-function deconvolution and background removal. Complementary line-ratio
    thermometry provides electron temperature across power, pressure, and gas-mix scans. Controlled H2
    seeding quantifies quenching and energy-transfer effects on N2 spectra, the appearance of Fulcher-α bands,
    and impacts on inferred Te via changes in collisional pathways. Actinometric normalizations and lamp-based
    radiometry convert relative spectra to emissivities with reported uncertainties. These well-diagnosed
    conditions validate collisional-radiative models and rate coefficients used in tokamak edge analysis, improve
    spectrometer calibrations, and inform how rotational/vibrational energy exchange and dissociation shape
    recycling and detachment chemistry in toroidal devices.
