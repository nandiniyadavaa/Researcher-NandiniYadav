  blurb: >
    I develop quantitative detachment metrics from absolutely-calibrated Balmer and continuum spectra,
    separating recombination and excitation and cross-validating with probes and cameras. The workflow
    tracks detachment/reattachment and extends to mixed-species, high-density hybrid plasmas, building
    on my APS-reported high-n Balmer / Fulcher work and an upcoming manuscript on Balmer-based detachment
    quantification. Goal: a machine-independent, uncertainty-aware recipe for real-time inference.

  blurb: >
    I lead end-to-end edge spectroscopy: sightlines, spectrograph/fiber selection, baffling, and radiometric
    calibration with uncertainty budgets (lamp transfer, slit function, linearity). The same rigor underpinned
    ADITYA-U instruments (space/time-resolved visible spectroscopy) and now supports DIII-D upgrades for impurity,
    neutral and molecular measurements—making inferences traceable enough to benchmark models and inform control.

    poster: ""
  blurb: >
    I analyze how seeded impurities and cold neutrals evolve through detachment onset and rollback, focusing
    on X-point radiation, particle sources and fueling balance. Building on ADITYA-U results (argon transport,
    rotation impacts, lithium conditioning, recycling studies), I link Balmer/Fulcher emissions to power exhaust,
    clarifying when radiation stabilizes detachment versus triggers re-attachment; outcomes guide seeding strategies.

    code: ""
  blurb: >
    I implement Abel/tomographic inversions with spectral priors (instrument function, Zeeman/Stark, molecular bands)
    to recover local emissivity and temperature surrogates from line-integrated measurements. Synthetic diagnostics
    and uncertainty propagation guard against over-interpretation. Methods honed on ADITYA-U now support DIII-D edge
    reconstructions used for model validation and scenario development.

    paper: ""
  blurb: >
    I established visible-line thermometry (Balmer, Fulcher) to estimate neutral/edge temperatures, quantify recycling,
    and show how wall conditioning (lithium, GDC) shifts particle balance. Results include poloidal asymmetries,
    gas-puff cold-pulse responses, and impurity behavior in high-performance shots, culminating in papers in Nuclear Fusion,
    RSI, Atoms, PFR and Scientific Reports.

  blurb: >
    I designed density-scan experiments across Greenwald fractions to quantify the degree of detachment,
    using calibrated Balmer/continuum diagnostics to separate recombination from excitation. Lower-divertor
    profiles distinguish atomic vs. molecular channels and provide code-validation targets under minimal baffling,
    NT geometry and varied leg length, with cross-checks to probes/imaging and opacity handling.

  blurb: >
    I extract neutral and impurity-ion temperatures from Doppler/Zeeman broadening and assess opacity/self-absorption.
    I plan and analyze Ar/Ne/H gas-puff and pellet-injection experiments to localize sources, capture transients and
    benchmark transport closures, fusing spectra, cameras, probes and helium-beam signals into consistent edge/divertor
    inferences with propagated uncertainties.

  blurb: >
    I quantify neutral/impurity influx from plasma-facing components and close the particle balance, including
    lithiumization and GDC effects on recycling coefficients, fueling asymmetries and wall sources. Calibrated
    emissions, beam data and wall models separate core fueling from edge return fluxes, tying wall state to confinement,
    ELM behavior and detachment stability.

  blurb: >
    I simulate edge/divertor transport with DEGAS2 and an in-house semi-implicit code (SITA) for O, C, Ne, Ar and Fe,
    generating synthetic spectra for direct comparison. Studies include molecular-hydrogen effects on recycling influx
    and diffusivity vs. Z trends in ADITYA-U. The tight experiment-model loop refines rates, informs diagnostics and
    accelerates convergence on edge conditions.

  blurb: >
    In RF/arc devices and the Plasma Wind Tunnel, I measure rotational/vibrational temperatures (N2, CN) via Boltzmann plots
    and derive electron temperature from line ratios, quantifying H2 admixture effects on spectra. Clean, calibrated datasets
    tighten rate choices and anchor spectral libraries used in tokamak inversions on DIII-D and ADITYA-U.
