  blurb: >
    I develop quantitative detachment metrics from absolutely-calibrated Balmer and continuum spectra,
    separating recombination and excitation and cross-validating with probes and cameras. The workflow
    tracks detachment/reattachment and extends to mixed-species, high-density hybrid plasmas, building
    on my APS-reported high-n Balmer / Fulcher work and an upcoming manuscript on Balmer-based detachment
    quantification. Goal: a machine-independent, uncertainty-aware recipe for real-time inference.

    I lead end-to-end edge spectroscopy: sightlines, spectrograph/fiber selection, baffling, and radiometric
    calibration with uncertainty budgets (lamp transfer, slit function, linearity). The same rigor underpinned
    ADITYA-U instruments (space/time-resolved visible spectroscopy) and now supports DIII-D upgrades for impurity,
    neutral and molecular measurements—making inferences traceable enough to benchmark models and inform control.

  blurb: >
    I analyze how seeded impurities and cold neutrals evolve through detachment onset and rollback, focusing
    on X-point radiation, particle sources and fueling balance. Building on ADITYA-U results (argon transport,
    rotation impacts, lithium conditioning, recycling studies), I link Balmer/Fulcher emissions to power exhaust,
    clarifying when radiation stabilizes detachment versus triggers re-attachment; outcomes guide seeding strategies.
